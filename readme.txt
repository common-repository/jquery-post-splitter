Wordpress has an excellent, but little known, [feature](http://codex.wordpress.org/Styling_Page-Links) for splitting up long posts into multiple pages. However, a growing trend among major news and blog sites is instead to split up posts into dynamically loading sliders. While there are many slider plugins available for Wordpress, none of them quite tackles this functionality. That's where the jQuery Post Splitter comes in: it takes normal multi-page posts from Wordpress and replaces them with jQuery transition, ajax and page-refresh methods.

= Tags =
slider, pagination, ajax, carousel, multi-page, newspaper

###Basic Features
* Posts and Pages can be divided into parts with page-breaks.
* View full post optional link
* Navigation captions can be edited
* Slides counter can be displayed
* Custom HTML and CSS can be added above and below post slides
* Scroll to top option is available for long posts
* Exceptional support on wordpress.org
* Slider navigation position
* Insert <br /> with each return key
* Slider count (e.g. "2 of 4") position
* Scroll to top after slide load? (jQuery/Ajax)
* Clean <!--nextpart—> / <!--nextpage--> tags from all posts/pages


###Advanced Features
* Default post navigation, line numbers display as pagination
* JavaScript Function on Slide, on each next and previous button you can trigger multiple JS functions
* Beautiful Styles for Slider Navigation
* SEO Trick - Display full content on first page as hidden?
* Loop slides - Creates an infinite loop of the slides
* Editable navigation captions
* Disable theme's default post navigation
* Display full content on first page as hidden
* Combine different pages/posts with shortcode

### What the slider does:

*	Provides an awesome functionality to combine many posts/pages into one with the shortcodes. Example: [JPS_CHUNK id="62" type="title"]

*   Replaces Wordpress' built-in post pagination funtionality with jQuery, ajax-based carousel and page-refresh method.

*   Uses hash based URLs for easy direct linking to specific slides. This also preserves the functionality of the browser's Back button.

*   Automatically adds slide navigation and a slide counter (e.g. '1 of 7') to sliders according to the preferences you set.

*   Adds the 'Insert Page Break' button to the TinyMCE post editor so that you can easily split your content into multiple pages/slides.

*   Provides an optional stylesheet for (very) basic styling of the slider navigation.

*	Optionally allows infinite looping of slides.

*	Optionally provides a link to view all slides on a single page.

*	Optionally allows for scrolling back to top when each slide loads.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'jquery-post-splitter' directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Customize your display options on the jQuery Post Splitter Settings page

4. Make paginated posts and pages using the newly visible 'Insert Page Break' button in the post editor



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can we enable an infinite loop within same post category on next and previous button? =

Yes, there is an option "Frog Jump" on settings page. If you turn that ON, on the last page you will get the permalink of the next alphabetically ordered and same with the previous button being on the first page while you are using infinite loop option.

[youtube https://youtu.be/IbqQH6BqKfc]

= How does it work with Ajax option? =

[youtube https://youtu.be/wpET7Kh717I]

= How does it work with Page Refresh option? =

[youtube https://youtu.be/H3tt1wjDwbs]

= Is there a way to insert Next/Prev buttons without the page break being inserted in that spot via shortcode? = 

This way I can insert the buttons anywhere, yet there is more content below. At this moment plugin is slicing the content and at the point of page break, it automatically inserts the button. You can do the trick with jQuery/JS instead, simply hide these buttons and trigger with jQuery. That's better instead of touching the default functionality.

= Do you have an affiliate program? =

No

= SEO Trick setting:  I don't understand what you mean by Display full content on first page as hidden? =

SEO Trick setting was added on the request of a user earlier. He was performing this and he asked me to add this feature, according to him search engine should be able to read the full content so users can reach to the right content page. As the remaining content will be available behind next and previous buttons so they will stay and content will be considered as valid, he added. 

= If I use JQuery setting (instead of AJAX), do search engines see all the content on the same url?  What setting is best for SEO without manipulating search engines? =

Ajax part is always hidden from search engines. Ajax don't perform unless we hit the next/prev button from the browsers/pages. jQuery and Page Refresh options are always better as jQuery brings all content to the page and page refresh is serving us with pagination, as search engines normally visit the sibling pages. Page refresh setting is the best and most of the people use it. But where internet is slow or your hosting server isn't responding well, jQuery option is better as people don't want to navigate a lot. So less number of pages should go to page refresh and more number of pages should go to jQuery option.

= How do I split up my posts into different slides? =
Just treat it like a normal Wordpress multi-page post. To make this extra-easy, the plugin activates the 'Insert Page Break' button in the post editor. Just insert your cursor wherever you want to break between slides and click the button - Bravo! You have a new slide!

For more information about Wordpress' built-in multi-page post funtionality, visit [this page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Styling_Page-Links).

= Why am I seeing an extra Next/Previous navigation element in my theme? =

Your theme contains its own `wp_link_pages()` tag to accomodate Wordpress' built-in post pagination feature. To ensure that this does not interfere with the plugin, please remove any reference to the  `wp_link_pages()` tag from your `single.php` file. Note that it is possible that the tag is inluded in a template part, rather than directly in the `single.php` file itself.

= How can I change the way the slider looks? =

The jQuery Post Splitter is designed to be syled by the user using standard CSS. On the plugin's Settings page, you can choose to use the included styles, but even these are meant only as a basic starting point.

= How can I shortcodes to form a post from different chunks? =
